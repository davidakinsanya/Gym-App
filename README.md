# Uplift.

## Uplift. - The gamification of getting stronger.

### Mission Statement

Uplift is a minimalist real-time leaderboard-based social platform for athletes and fitness enthusiasts who prioritise strength and athleticism. The app is centered around tracking and ranking performance around primarily the three major compound movements in the gym; The Squat, Bench Press and Deadlift. 

Our platform would serve as a counteracting force in the fitness community as the worlds of fitness and social media intermingle in ways which challenge as well as reveal our real motivations as to why we go to the gym in the first place. We rely on and play up to the utilisation of gamification techniques present in a lot of today’s social media platforms in hopes of targeting and successfully recalibrating parts of the psychology of many casual lifters into going into the gym with the priority more so to build strength rather than to play up to social media’s fitness standards and expectation. The gamification element comes in when we reconsider the act of going to the gym as a skill-based game. 

In competitive online skill-based games players are ranked based on skill using an ELO ranking, our solution will borrow the concept of ELO and simply apply it to the gym; considering: your participation, your performance in compound lifts and days/weeks you have not been in the gym. Lifters will remain anonymous able will be able to view and track the performance of each other through global and regional leaderboards initially to add a healthy competitive edge to the platform with room for more use cases.
